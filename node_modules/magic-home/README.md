# Magic Home for Node

Functionality ported from https://github.com/beville/flux_led to Node.js.

# Features
Control lights which are usually controlled with [this app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-home-wifi/id944574066?mt=8) with Node.

**Control**: Turn lights on and off. Set colors. Start effects. Make programmatic effects.  
**Discovery**: Discover lights on the network.  
**CustomMode**: Install custom effects (color fade, jump or strobe) with up to 16 colors.

# Installation

```
npm install magic-home
```

You can also install the library globally with `npm i -g magic-home`. This gives you access to the Magic Home command line utility, aptly named `magic-home`. Run 

```
$ magic-home
``` 
to get a list of commands and options.

# Usage

Simple example:

```javascript
const { Control } = require('magic-home');

let light = new Control("192.168.1.100");
light.setPower(true).then(success => {
	// do something with the result
});
```

Simple discovery example:

```javascript
const { Discovery } = require('magic-home');

let discovery = new Discovery();
discovery.scan(500).then(devices => {
	// do something with the result
});
```

More examples are in `cli.js` and the examples directory.

# Methods

## Control

All methods return a promise which resolves to the specific value.  
Each method has an optional callback parameter as well. All of these callbacks will be called with `(err, value)`.

*static get* **patternNames**  
Returns the hard-coded list of supported patterns as an array.

*static* **ackMask**(mask)  
Create an `ack` option object by supplying a bitmask with the bits representing booleans. Bit 1 = power, Bit 2 = color, Bit 3 = pattern, Bit 4 = custom_pattern.  
Example: `Control.ackMask(1)` would set `power` to `true` and all other values to `false`.

**constructor**(address, options)  
Creates a new instance of the API. This does not connect to the light yet.  
Accepted options:
- `ack` An object of the form `{ power: true, color: true, pattern: true, custom_pattern: true }` indicating for which types of command an acknowledging response is expected. Some controllers acknowledge some commands and others don't, so this option has to be found out by trial-and-error. If the Promise does not resolve after a command was completed successfully, you probably need to set some of these to false. Use the CLI with the *--bytes* and *--ack 15* parameter to find out if the controller sends replies. You can use the `Control.ackMask(mask)` static function for convenience to set all options with less code.
- `log_all_received` Log all received data to the console for debug purposes. (Default: false).
- `apply_masks` Set a special mask bit in the `setColor` and `setWarmWhite` methods, which is required for some controllers, which can't set both values at the same time, like bulbs for example.
This value is automatically set to `true` if `queryState` detects a controller of type `0x25`. (Default: false)
- `connect_timeout` Duration in milliseconds after which a controller will be regarded as non-reachable, if a connection can not be established.
Normally, this should be handled by your OS and you get an _EHOSTUNREACH_ error, but this allows you to set a custom timeout yourself. (Default: null _[No timeout/let the OS handle it]_)
- `wait_for_reply` **[Deprecated, use ack option instead]**

**setPower**(on, callback)  
Turns a light either on or off.

**turnOn**(callback)  
Convenience method to call `setPower(true)`.

**turnOff**(callback)  
Convenience method to call `setPower(false)`.

**setColorAndWarmWhite**(red, green, blue, ww, callback)  
Sets both color and warm white value at the same time.

**setColor**(red, green, blue, callback)  
Convenience method to only set the color values.
Because the command has to include both color and warm white values, previously seen warm white values will be sent together with the color values.

**setWarmWhite**(ww, callback)  
Convenience method to only set the warm white value.
Because the command has to include both color and warm white values, previously seen color values will be sent together with the warm white value.

**setColorWithBrightness**(red, green, blue, brightness, callback)  
Convenience method to automatically scale down the rgb values to match the brightness parameter (0 - 100).
This method uses `setColor()` internally, so it could set the warm white value to something unexpected.

**setPattern**(pattern, speed, callback)  
Sets the light to play a built-in pattern. The `pattern` parameter is a string which indicates the pattern (complete list below). The speed parameter has to be between 0 and 100.

**setCustomPattern**(pattern, speed, callback)  
Sets the light to play a custom pattern, defined with the `CustomMode` (see below). An example can be found in _examples/custom_mode_test.js_. The speed parameter has to be between 0 and 100.

**queryState**(callback)  
Gets the state of the light. Example state:

```javascript
{
	type: 0x33, // can also be 0x04, 0x25 or 0x81 according to the python library
	on: true,
	mode: "color", // color, custom, special, or one of the built-in patterns
	speed: 50, // playback speed of the current pattern
	color: {
		red: 255,
		green: 0,
		blue: 255
	},
	warm_white: 0,
	cold_white: 0 // some controllers support this value, but there is currently no way to set it with this library
}
```

**startEffectMode**(callback)  
Start the effect mode. In this mode, a single connection will be kept open, instead of reconnecting for every command. This method resolves to the `EffectInterface` (documented below) once the persistent connection to the controller is established. An example can be found in _examples/effect_test.js_. This can be used to replicate the music visualization from the app for example.

## EffectInterface

An instance of this class is obtained by calling `startEffectMode`.

**start**(interval_function)  
Starts the effect mode. The `interval_function` will be called every time the last command has been fully processed. It will be called without any parameters.

**setColor**(red, green, blue)  
This method is only supposed to be called from within the `interval_function`. Sets the color.

**delay**(milliseconds)  
This method is only supposed to be called from within the `interval_function`. Calling this method, will lead to the next call to the interval function to happen after the specified time.

**stop**()  
Closes the connection to the light and leads to the interval function not being called anymore.

## Discovery

*static* **scan(timeout)**  
This static method can be used for convenience when the list of clients does not need to be stored within the `Discovery` instance and when the callback parameter is not needed.

**constructor**()  
Creates a new instance of the Discovery Mode. This does not perform the actual scan yet.

**scan**(timeout, callback)  
Broadcasts a discovery packet to the network and then waits `timeout` milliseconds for a reply from the controllers. The devices are returned in an array of objects like this:

```javascript
{
	address: "<ip address>",
	id: "<12 character ID>",
	model: "<Model number>"
}
```

_get_ **clients**  
Contains the list of clients returned in the last call to `scan()`.

_get_ **scanned**  
Boolean value indicating if `scan()` has already been called on this instance.


## CustomMode

All methods in this class can be chained together.

**constructor**()

**addColor**(red, green blue)  
Appends the specified color to the list of colors in the effect.

**addColorList**(list)  
Appends multiple colors at once.
The list needs to have the format `[ [r1, g1, b1], [r2, g2, b2], ...]`

**setTransitionType**(type)  
Set the type of the transition to be either `fade`, `jump`, or `strobe`.
